A program to store business contacts

The application presented here is a simple program, written in python, that will allow the user to input, search and sort basic business contact details. The application will have the following fundamental functions:

1. It will prompt the user to input contact data to make up a contact record and will confirm when a record has been added
2. It will store the individual contact records in a 2-dimensional 'Contact Master List'
3. The user will be able to sort the records alphabetically by first name or last name
4. The user will be able to search records based on the last name within a record
5. The user will be able to delete records based on the last name within a record and will confirm when a record has been deleted

TEST POINTS:
1. Check that the individual contact records are being stored in sub-lists correctly
2. Check that the Contact Master List is printing correctly



Problems to be ammended:
- Sorted lists favour uppercase over lower case, so if one record is written beginning with a lower case letter it will appear at the end of the list
